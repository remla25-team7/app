# app

A simple Flask-based web application that allows users to submit restaurant reviews and view the predicted sentiment (positive or negative). Has a frontend and connects to an external model-service for analysis.

## What This App Does

- Accepts a user-submitted review from a web form
- Sends the review text to a separate `model-service`
- Displays the predicted sentiment on the same page
- Shows the current version using a reusable `lib-version` utility
